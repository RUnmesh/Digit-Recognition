# Digit-Recognition

ML models to recognize digits in MINST database
THere is a typo in the name of the project: the organization is MNIST, and not MINST. We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this error; the OP doesn't really care much about anything other than code. Other than that error, this is pretty much what it says on the can: it is a number recognition program. Code is written in Python to incorporate elements of Machine Learning.
